  "Transcript (from Media)": [
    "Alright, just tell me your name and what do you do for your work and stuff? My name's Chloe and I'm the Aboriginal Homeless Fringe Rela Support Worker here. So I go out to Boulder Camp and Ningamai every day, supporting them with breakfast. Breakfast, cold water, hot cups of tea, coffee. If they have any problems, anything of need, I help them with that, assist them. I think it would be awesome if you do context of Ningalmy and Boulder Camp. It's an interesting one to be able to describe. How would you describe those communities, I guess? Interesting. Interesting. It can be challenging at times, but once you connect with them, they're actually lovely people and just like everyone else. There is a bit of things that go on out there with the drinking side of things. But then there's the issue behind that too. So they drink because they're homeless for one. It's hard to... Tell us a bit about, we've seen it and hung around and stuff. What's the sleeping conditions like for you? Rough, it's rough, sad. I leave from work every day going home worrying about them, especially with the weather changing all the time. So when it's raining it gets quite muddy out there, cold, muddy. I've put up with a few of my clients going to hospital with pneumonia from sleeping on the ground because it's too cold. And then in the summer I've put up with them telling me constantly like, we're scared to sleep here, we're scared to sleep there because of snakes. So they put up a lot with snakes, little bugs like that. But then we've had issues where people have went out there burning their blankets because they're intoxicated or burning their blankets, mattresses, things like that as well. Yeah, we've had that issue. Yeah, we just made his little bed here. What's your first impression of what this thing is? I think at first when you told me about it, I'm just like, yeah like yeah no I don't think that's possible but now that you've just showed us and helped us put it together it's amazing. It is a good idea. One it's getting them off the cold ground, well yeah it's getting them off the cold ground less chances of probably pneumonia or any other sickness. Also in the summer it's getting them off the ground for snakes, bugs, whatever bugs. They can pack it up easily and cart it with them but then the clean side of things, keep it clean, hygiene, yeah. Yeah, is there anything that you could talk a little bit about, things that you might change or ideas about things that could improve it? Do you have any of those points? A carry bag will be good, because a lot of them are homeless and going from place to place, town to town, house to house. So a really good strong carry bag that's going to last a while would be good. And you know how he mentioned with the straps to cut on the back, that's a good idea too. But yeah, I'm sure. That's cool. Yeah. But yeah, I'm sure. That's cool. Yeah. We went at Dingamai this morning. There was three lovely old ladies and they were in a tent and there were six of them in there with various types of bedding. What did you think of the long-term health and wellbeing outcomes? Can you say that again? What do you think of the long term health and wellbeing outcomes we can get? I reckon it would, if we had these everywhere, out in Inghamah or Boulder Camp, like them two places, I reckon it might improve the health side of things. Like I said, they're sleeping on a cold ground and that's straight away pneumonia in hospital. Some of them are elders, so I've had a few sent down to Perth because of it, because they're old and the coldness is affecting them, that it could kill them. So this must prevent that because they're off the ground and not, yeah. Can they fit in, quick question, can they fit in a tent? Yeah, there was one in the tent last night. Oh, so there was one in the tent last night. There's a caravan and there was a tent there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in that tent there, there was one. There was three ladies sleeping on it last night. Yeah, right, yeah. What about like mattresses in terms of bacteria and that sort of stuff? Do you think that's an issue? Yeah, I think that is an issue because you tend to have so many of them sleeping on this one mattress over a period of time. So someone will come from one of the communities in the land and maybe use that mattress, but then they'll go back home to the land, the mattress stays there, and then someone else will come and then they'll use it. So there'll be a number of people using the same mattress over and over and over now these mattresses don't get treated they don't get cleaned so that's another thing like the bed bugs and whatever else lives in a mattress yeah and is there any things that we should be doing do you think in terms of how we're engaging with community or partners or is there any recommendations from from like working at Vega for some time like learning we should be doing to help people feel engaged with the project? Well you already are doing it, you're reaching out and that's the number one start like the start of it is to reach out and connect with them and see their feed getting their feedback. Everyone's got a voice and I think it's good that you went and got their feedback reached out and let them have their opinion on like how did you ask them how maybe they would like it taint everyone yeah yeah yeah so it was it was really great to be able to just do it with them yeah yeah and then let them sleep on it yeah and then nick's going to come back in a few weeks time and I think that's that long-term thinking and getting feedback. It might work for one night, but does it work for two weeks? Does it work for two years? It would be interesting to know how that works long-term. So right now, here and now, it's also an idea for the weather, also the hygiene side of things. but then you wouldn't really know I guess until it gets tried out long term to see if it's going to work or not. Yeah, it's just shocking sometimes in these communities how nothing survives, right? Like everything there is being denigrated or rusty or whatever. Yeah, yeah. It'll be interesting to see how we go. It will be interesting, yeah. Thank you so much. No worries, thank you. You did so great.\","
